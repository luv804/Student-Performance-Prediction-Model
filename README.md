# Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression
## Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple linear regression refers to a statistical technique that uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome of a dependent variable. 
## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a Student Performance Prediction System using multiple linear regression techniques. Educational institutions often face challenges in predicting students' academic performance based on various factors.
Predicting student performance accurately can help educators identify students at risk of underperforming, provide timely interventions, and personalize learning strategies. This system aims to analyze historical student data and build a regression model to predict a student's final grade, given multiple influencing factors.
## Objectives of the Project
+ Develop a predictive model that uses these factors to estimate a student's future performance :
  + Study hours
  + Previous scores
  + Extracurricular activities
  + Sleep hours
  + Sample question papers practiced
+ Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the model to ensure it can be effectively used by educators and institutions.
## Python Libraries Used :
+ Numpy
+ Pandas
+ Scikit-learn
## About the Dataset
The dataset used to build this model was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression
## Results
The predictive model demonstrated an accuracy of 98% when evaluated on the test data
